when I was twenty-three, I married to a pretty widow.

This widow had a grown-up daughter.

My father loved her.

Soon they wed.

This made my dad my son-in-law.

My daughter was my mother, because she was my father's wife.

I became the father of a bouncing baby boy.

My little baby then became a brother-in-law to Dad.

So he became my uncle.

If he was my uncle, then that also made him brother of the widow's grown-up daughter, who was my stepmother.

Father's wife then had a son.

He became my grandchild, because he was my daughter's son.

My wife is now my mother's mother.

Although she is my wife, she's my grandmother, too.

If my wife is my grandmother, then I'm her grandchild.

As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandfather!

I'm my own grandpa.
